           <i style="font-family: 'Niconne', cursive; font-size: 35px; line-height: 60px;margin: 20px;color:var(--pink)">Hey</i>, I am Maisha Maliha. I am from Bangladesh. I am studying Computer Science and Engineering. This is my blog about my journey to achieving my goals in life. This is more of a journal, a diary, a note and place for suggestions and life lessons for me and you. I felt the need to write about everything that’s happening to me in life. It might help you and me in future. This is something my future kids may see to know how, why and what I did in life, hehe. 
        </p>
        <h2>What got me into computer science and engineering?</h2>
        <p>
            So it all started when I was in 7th grade. I used to love 3D animated cartoons. So my uncle introduced me to Autodesk 3d Max. I found it very interesting even though it seemed hard. But I liked it because I can do amazing stuff with it. So I started learning it. And I fell in love with it.  I started building houses and cartoon faces and their body. 	I used to make the bodies walk and also started morphing. I started learning to make the mouth move. I also used to play a lot of games. So I thought about building games. Then I got introduced to another software that helps in building games. So the whole thought that I can do so many stuff using software got me interested into the whole concept of software and computers in general. But soon my dad noticed I was spending too much time on the computer so he stopped me from using them. So then I stopped. But I knew that <strong>I WANTED TO LEARN MORE ABOUT COMPUTERS AND SOFTWARE</strong>.  That’s how I got into building stuff using computer.
        </p>
        <p>
            When I was in 11th grade or College (According to Bangladesh Education System), I started a Blog. And I wanted to be able to design my blog according to my taste. That’s when I started learning about web development. I started doing more research on web development. And then started learning HTML and CSS. 
        </p>
        <p>
            After all these incidents I was sure that I wanted a career in Computer Science and engineering. 
        </p>
