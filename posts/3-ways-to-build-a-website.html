                    If you are reading this post then I assume you are completely new to the world of web development. This post will help you understand how to build a website from scratch. Just to clear that, in this post I will only talk about how to build a website, not how to deploy it or make it go live on the internet. Those are different topic. I will cover them later and will link to it once I write about it.
                </p>
                <p>
                    So, I am going to divide this post of web development into three parts. Because there are three ways you can build a website: 
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Through Buying Templates</li>
                    <li>Through using websites which let you build website by dragging and dropping</li>
                    <li>Through raw coding everything.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>I will explain them serially, don’t worry.</p>
                <h2>Buying Templates</h2>
                <p>
                    This is the easiest and the fastest way to build a website. All you do is buy a website template from a website. And upload it to your hosting. Templates are examples of website designs. You get what you see.  They are completely built for you, using HTML, CSS and JavaScript and maybe PHP as well if you choose a template with back-end technology. They are simply files with code in them, which is the website code. So you basically buy the codes of the website and then you upload it wherever you want, which is a hosting. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Some famous websites are : Themeforest, Templatemonster, etc. You choose the template you like. The templates are sold in zip files, sometimes the raw files are given. You extract the zip file somewhere in your computer and then you just upload the extracted files on your hosting website. Some supports zip file too. That’s it.
                </p>
                <h2>Drag and Drop</h2>
                <p>
                    This one is more customizable. You build your website according to your taste and design. But of course there are some limitations. You will build your website by dragging and dropping on the website. For example, if you want to put a button on your website you just choose a button and drag it and then put it where you want it. You can also customize the button. Some websites that lets you build websites like this are: Wix, Weebly, GoDaddy, etc. 
                </p>
                <h2>Raw Coding</h2>
                <p>
                    Now is the coding part where you can build your website however you want with whatever technology you want. Here everything is under your control. You decide the look and feel of the website and what happens in the backend, if there is any. Through coding, you can build either a great or a worst website. It’s up to how you code. Through coding you can build websites that can’t be built using those drag and drops. Also when buying templates, it is not possible to find a template that exactly matches your requirement. So here you either code or hire a web developer to build a completely custom website. For example, you can’t build a gaming website using drag and drop or by buying templates. For that you need raw coding, either yourself or by a web developer.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Now coding a website from scratch is not easy. There are many steps you have to follow to be able to build a website. There are five steps:
                </p>
                <h3>1. Idea</h3>
                <p>
                    At first you have to decide the type of your website. You need to know what website and type of website you are building. Because, on the basis of the type of your website, you will understand what content you have to put on your website and what technology you need to use. 
                </p>
                <h3>2. Prototyping</h3>
                <p>
                    Now that you know what type of website you are going to build and what contents you are going to put in it, it’s time to create prototypes of your website. This is the part where UI and UX designers work. They design the whole website layout. They take care of everything related to where to put what and how to make it easy for the user to use and give a great user experience. 
                </p>
                <h3>4. Front-end</h3>
                <p>
                    Now that the whole website has been designed. It’s time to code it down. At first a Front-end developer builds the whole front side of the website. <mark>Everything you see in a website is the front-end of the website that is built by a Front-End Web Developer</mark>. A Front-end developer uses technologies like: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React js, etc, to build the front side of the website. For example, the buttons, the footer, the links, the inputs, the animations, etc. 
                </p>
                <h3>5. Back-end</h3>
                <p>
                    Mainly a Back-End Developers job is to connect to the database, get data from database and show it in the website or take data from user and keep it in database. This is one of the many things a Back-End Developer does. There are many more a backend developer can do. But mainly in a website this is a must know for a back-end developer. <mark>Everything related to the server side is handled by a Back-End Web Developer.</mark>
                </p>
                <p>
                    When you visit a website, in some websites you give input like your name, address or email and click on a button. Then this data is saved in a database. This work is done by a back-end developer. For example, when you create an account in any website, you put your email and password. Then when you again try to login, you put your email and password and you are logged in. The fact that you have an account, how do they know? If there was no back-end or database, no data of yours will be saved on the internet and you have to redo everything again and again. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Not all websites require Back-End. Because not all website wants to or needs to take input from users.<mark> If the website is a simple website where you just show stuff then it is just a Static Website. But the websites that require Back-end are called Dynamic websites.</mark>The technologies a Back-end Developer needs are: PHP, MYSQL, Laravel, etc.
                </p>
                <p>
                    So now you know how a website is built from scratch. Hope this helped. If it did, share it with your friends who are also interested in building website.
